# stealy

Stealy is a text-based adventure game about breaking into someones house and stealing stuff. 

Interaction is through the command line, maps are procedurally generated, and the game has a simple version of pokemon-style combat.

My first python project.

### Installing
Just clone the repo

Run stealy using Python 2

`$ python stealy3.py`

### Future jobs
A print map function
